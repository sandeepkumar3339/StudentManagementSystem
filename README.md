# StudentManagementSystem

ABSTRACT: 
The student attendance management system is a mini project that
aims to simplify and streamline the current attendance system through
a password protected system. It provides various features that are
targeted to ease the communication between the administration,
teachers and students. This project was designed with a modular
approach using the Java programming language and SQL and thus
implements various features of it into the code.

INTRODUCTION: 
The 21st century is all about technology. Schools and colleges are also
starting to incorporate more and more technology into their teaching The
management and maintenance of student information is a key task for any
institution. Marking attendance are one of the many essential tasks of the
subject handlers, since marking the attendance can regulate the students to
attend the sessions. As a result an Attendance Management System was
developed to try and help replace the old system of taking manual
attendance. Attendance Management System is an application for taking
daily attendance in schools and colleges. It provides minimal error in report
generation of a particular studentâ€™s attendance. The main motive behind this
software is to replace the traditional pen and register system. Another reason
for developing this software is to generate the report automatically at the
end of the session or in the between of the session.
